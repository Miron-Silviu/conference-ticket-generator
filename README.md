### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
